JATAYU Logic Minimization Tool
By Venkata Krishna Nimmagadda & Vivek Tulsidas Bhat

This README file gives a detailed explanation on how to use the JATAYU logic minimization 
utility.

Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------
1. GNU make 3.81 (or later) 
2. gcc 4.4.1 (or later)

The folder contains a Makefile for compilation and three folders : src, include, 
input_test_files and doc. The 'src' folder contains all the C source files which implement 
the JATAYU logic minimization tool. The 'include' folder contains the relevant header files 
that are used for the implementation. The 'input_test_files' contains all the input test vectors 
that we have used for testing out the performance of the JATAYU logic minimizer.

Compilation
-----------
To compile the source code simply type 'make' on your terminal. An output file called 'logic_min'
should be generated if the compilation is successful. 

Using the logic_min executable
------------------------------
The logic_min executable can be used in one of three possible ways :

1. It can be used to generate a verilog file that contains the behavioral modular
   implementation of the optimized function. To do this, use the following command
   on the terminal :

   ./logic_min << path to your input file here >> -v << your desired output file name here >>

   You do not need to add the '.v' extension to your output file name.

2. It can also be used to generate a text file that contains the realization of the optimized function. 
   To do this, use the following command on the terminal :

   ./logic_min << path to your input file here >> -t << your desired output file name here >>

   A .txt extension is automatically appended to your output file name.

3. JATAYU uses the ESPRESSO EXPAND approach to arrive at the optimized function. You can obtain the 
   optimized output by using the following command on the terminal : 

   ./logic_min << path to your input file here >> -e << your desired output file name here >>

   A .txt extension is automatically appended to your output file name.

Input file specifications
------------------------- 
Input file specifications should conform to the sample input file example given below.

Eg :

# Your comments go here

.i 2          #Number of input variables
.ilb a b c d  #Input variables
.o 1          #Number of output variables. JATAYU currently does not support multiple-output functions
.ob F         #Output variable

# Truth table goes here

00 0
01 1
10 1
11 0

.e # Optional end of file indicator

The output text file generated will also conform to the specifications indicated above.
 

Implementation details
----------------------
To learn more about how JATAYU has been implemented, please refer to the documents provided in the 'doc'
folder.
